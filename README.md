# Ac<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>

Rust implementation of an Anderson Acceleration algorithm based on Ref [1].<br>
Please note: There is an original [Matlab implementation](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/papers/nonexp_global_aa1.html)
as well as a slightly modified [implementation in C](https://www.cvxgrp.org/scs/algorithm/acceleration.html) (including 
a Python interface) by the authors of the paper.<br>
Ac<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> is a port of the C implementation to Rust.
