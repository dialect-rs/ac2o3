# Ac<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>
[![CI](https://github.com/dialect-rs/ac2o3/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/dialect-rs/ac2o3/actions/workflows/CI.yml)


Rust implementation of an Anderson Acceleration algorithm based on Ref [1].<br>
Please note: There is an original [Matlab implementation](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/papers/nonexp_global_aa1.html)
as well as a slightly modified [implementation in C](https://www.cvxgrp.org/scs/algorithm/acceleration.html) (including 
a Python interface) by the authors of the paper.<br>
Ac<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> is a port of the C implementation to Rust.

### Dependencies
Building Ac<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> requires the following to be installed: 
- OpenBLAS: <br>
On linux systems you can either install it by just executing `sudo apt-get install libopenblas-dev` or follow 
the instructions on the [repository page](https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS).
On macOS OpenBLAS can be installed using [HomeBrew](): `brew install openblas`. Make sure that the homebrew path is 
 included in `$LIBRARY_PATH`. So you might need to execute: <br>
  `export LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/homebrew/Cellar/:$LIBRARY_PATH` (on Apple Silicon/M1 processors)<br>
  `export LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/Cellar/:$LIBRARY_PATH` (on Intel processors)<br>
